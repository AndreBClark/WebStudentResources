## Web Image Guidelines

### Initial Considerations
* Tightly crop the images

### Illustrations
* Transparent Background
* White color skin or whatever
* thumbnail and medium size
* Square proportion

### Image resolutions
DPI/PPI: **72**

Colospace: **RGB**

colormode **sRGB**

### File Format
**PNG** Use for flat color images, such as the illustrations

**JPG** for full color complex Raster Images, Especially Photographs

### Naming Convention
lowercase, underscore for separation, hyphens-for-group

`Folder/[file-name]_[width in pixels].[ext]`

example: **characters/med/joe_300.png**

Folders: `branding`, `characters`, `portfolio-items`, `misc`

sized folders: `sm`,`med`,`lg`,`hero`


### File Sizes

**<500KB** is Ideal
no more than **3MB**

_file too big?_ refer to the [Image-Optimization](#Image-Optimization) section

### File Dimensions

image widths:

Thumbnail: **150px**

Medium: **300px**

Large: **1024px**

Full page: **1920px**
_Ask Andre if this is needed first_


### Image Optimization
Be sure to use '**lossless**' compression methods if you want to avoid distortion. Not required but would save us a ton of time and would be greatly appreciated.

It is highly recommended to use this in your own personal workflows for digital/web/social media content as it reduces the file sizes with no noticeable difference.
* On Mac Use [Imageoptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) it outputs lossless by default.
